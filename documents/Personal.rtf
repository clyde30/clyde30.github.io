\f0\fs24 \cf0 I was born and raised in Texas, but currently reside in New Mexico.  I have been teaching for the past six years at a small private school.  Prior to teaching, I worked at children\'92s camps.  I have been married for almost seven years, and have two young children.  \

I enjoy the mountain town that we live in and try to spend as much time as possible outside.  My hobbies include fly fishing, hiking, camping and woodworking.  My son is just now getting to the age that I can take him with me when I go hiking and fishing, and am looking forward to more outdoor outings with my family.   }
